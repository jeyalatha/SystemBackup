1. Request for Code Generation UI:  -- Completed and Released
	In Component tab, Add the below 2 columns after workflow offset column:

		1. MDCF --  check box -- if it selected, it should be saved as 'Y' Else it should be saved as 'N'
		2. Device Config path -- Edit - Engg_Description -- It is already there in the table, if exists, it should fetch from the table.
				and should save the given value.
		Both the columns should be available in the table engg_devcon_codegen_options
		
2.	Dependency Viewer Api to return feature id / rTRACK id for given ECR in platform API-- Completed and Released
		Needs to be added the above 2 columns in the Platform API - SP-Task

3.	Two APIs must be published to get object description	-- Pending
		To get the table, view, function, Table valued function and Synonym
			

4. Depth level SP result for ERP Components -- no need to fetch the dependent object list..only count is enough
	ERP - Model and Application backups are available in the techwarcnv57 server.
		Changes: not required depth level objects..need model sp name and their depth level alone
		
		Sample Data:
		=============
		Depth 1 - CFS_Vehicle, EAMREP,    EWBM
		Depth 3 - OfflineReports_Exp,    WMSReports,    AdditionalParameters
		Depth 4 - PPVW,    ISA,    BUBCT,    SVA
	
5. 	Depmeta change for evolv configuration -- Completed and released
		SP change
		
6. MDCF - Service based mdcf sp change -- Completed 
		DE_MDCF_SERVICE_TEMPLATE_SP

7. application table name,column name -- Pending

8. Model Explorer APIs - InProgress

I take care of platform development.
This week we added few features in the dependence viewer.	
	Provision to display the rtrackid and FeatureID for the given ECR.
	Provision to get all the referencing objects for the given application stored procedure
	REverse impact analysis - to fetch the list of component,activity, ui and task
	
Model Explorer:
	Provided API to fetch all the solutioning nodes like Customer, Project, Process, component
	
	currently we do the APIs to fetch the Engineering nodes like Documents, Service, Process section, Method and their parameters
	
	modernization of platform 
	
	
node text - sp name
bro instead of method
