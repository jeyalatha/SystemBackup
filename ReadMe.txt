Common elements
Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays.
Example 1:
Input:
n1 = 6; A = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
n2 = 5; B = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
n3 = 8; C = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20 80
Explanation: 20 and 80 are the only
common elements in A, B and C.

1. START
2. declare 3 arrays X[], Y[], Z[]
3. declare 3 variables i=0,j=0,k=0
4. if X[i] < Y[j] then i=i+1 else j = j +1
5. if X[i] = Y[j] then R[l] = X[i]
6. if j <n2 goto step 4
7. IF R[i] < Z[k] then i = i + 1
8. k = k+1
9. if R[i] = Z[k] then PRINT R
9. if k < n3 goto step 7
10. stop
